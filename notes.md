# Notes

* Pan(drag) Zoom(scroll wheel)

* `GET of whole transaction_history.json` and `transactionHistory.reverse().map()`. Not most efficient but will do for now. Could use Server Sent Events, so stream in customers transactions in chronological order and draw with canvas.

* UI improvements: could use bar chart and split each bar into current CAD, BTC and ETH balance.

* UI improvements: let customer select data range, add some nice animation and easing

* Extra feature: customer may want to see their profit and not just net worth. Plot profit

* Use of vanilla js and lint/styling(`function(){}` instead of `() => {}`) questions. Current editor setup for client project

* TODO: Add some tests, test on mobile/browsers, use next.js etc
